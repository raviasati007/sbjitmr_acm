            The AI and machine learning domain is a
rapidly evolving field at the intersection of
computer science, mathematics, and
statistics. It encompasses the development of
algorithms and models that enable
computers to learn from data and make
intelligent decisions without explicit
programming. From natural language
processing and computer vision to predictive
analytics and autonomous systems, AI and
machine learning technologies are
revolutionizing industries and transforming
the way we interact with technology. As
research continues to advance, the potential
for innovation and impact across various
domains, including healthcare, finance,
transportation, and beyond, is boundless.
This FDP on "AI and Machine Learning"
serves as a platform to empower educators
with the knowledge, skills, and resources
necessary to effectively teach and integrate
these transformative technologies into
academic curricula. Through interactive
sessions, workshops, and hands-on exercises,
participants will gain a comprehensive
understanding of AI and machine learning
concepts, methodologies, and applications. It
is designed to equip educators with the
knowledge, skills, and resources needed to
effectively teach and integrate AI and
machine learning concepts into their
curriculum.
